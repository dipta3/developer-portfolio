                <p>Analysts can either work ‘in-house’ for a company, where they will solely work on projects for their employer, or be employed by an analyst or consulting firm and will usually travel to a client’s office and be based there for the duration of a project. The length of business analysts’ involvement in projects can vary, as they may only be present in the short-term, coming up with solutions to a problem, or on a long-term basis, where they will assist in the implementation of the solution.</p>

                <h3 class="voilet-color">2022-Present  |  Pro Level Analyst</h3>
                    <p>In addition to performing financial and operational modelling, a Business Analyst is expected to develop new models that underpin sound business decisions. A Business Analyst job description should recognise the streamlining and improving of internal and external reporting. The role should also call for a strong understanding of regulatory and reporting requirements as well as plenty of experience in forecasting, budgeting and financial analysis combined with understanding of key performance indicators.</p>
